            <h2>Speaking</h2>

            <p>
                (12â€“17 minutes per pair of candidates)

                The B1 Preliminary Speaking test has four parts and you take it together with another candidate. There
                are
                two examiners. One of the examiners talks to you and the other examiner listens. It shows how good your
                spoken English is as you take part in conversation by asking/answering questions and talking, for
                example,
                about your likes and dislikes. Your Speaking test will be conducted face to face with one or two other
                candidates and two examiners. This makes your test more realistic and more reliable.
            </p>
